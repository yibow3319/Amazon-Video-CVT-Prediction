# Amazon-Video-CVT-Prediction
In this project, supervised learning techniques are applied to predict the cumulative view time per day for Amazon video content based on various movie features. The goal is to use attributes such as IMDb rating, budget, box office performance, and homepage positioning to forecast how much time users spend watching a video each day.

Several machine learning models are utilized to perform this regression task, and the results are analyzed to determine which features have the most significant impact on viewing time. The predictions and model evaluations help uncover patterns in user engagement with different types of content.
